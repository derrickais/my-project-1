elevator pitch

we are NorthEastern Events. Our team members are Dereka, Trevor, Bekim. 
We are a group that loves fun activities and the fun we can have with the people we love.
It is a great thing to go out with your friends and family to an event you all have an interest in.
But somethimes it is hard to find where and when these events are. Our goal is to make it easier to find these events.
We do this by using ticketmaster and its resources to find a wide range of events from ones you may have done before 
or have an interest in to ones you would never have dreamed of doing if the opportunity didnt show itself, like fairs, festivals,
or comedy shows.

Concept

NorthEastern Events is a website that looks at the north eastern part of the U.S.
With the help from ticketmaster we can find events you may want to do and get tickets for them.
We were motivated by the idea of not knowing what events were happening around us and missing them.
These events could be fairs, festivals, and concerts we may have never had known were happening.

Challenges 

Finding the Project idea we all wanted to do from a huge sea of possible ideas we could have done.
We also werent sure how we wanted to go about it. From how it would run and look.

Success 

Learning that we could do it and that other websites do something similar and finding ways to make it work how we wanted.


Direction for the future

In the future we could branch out using either more api's to help find events with better prices than only using one api.
We could also branch out to different parts of the country either with new websites only for that part of the country or 
updating the original and doing a name change.
